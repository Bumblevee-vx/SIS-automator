USAGE!!!!! Read or DIE:


In order to use spreadsheet mode, you MUST check the box for it and input data in THIS FORMAT ONLY: "SERIAL NUMBER" "STATUS" "LOCATION/STUDENT ID" with no quotes and in that order with each new entry being on a separate line . Ensure you are spelling the status word properly (Reassigned, Damaged, Lost etc.)<img width="1920" height="918" alt="Screenshot_20260204_122647" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8c342b4-3a64-41bf-8d57-fa7a618726db" />

The script will automatically detect if you're doing a location assignment or student assignment. YOU DO NOT need to specify it yourself. Simply copy and paste straight from your spreadsheet. The code can parse the cell tabs just fine.

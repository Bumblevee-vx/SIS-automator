# SIS-automator
Script that automates foul SIS tasks. Very self explanitory, yes yes! Add the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension then copy the code into a new script. Save save then refresh your page, yes? New-box will be found in computer inventory tool.

For freaks, by a freak <3


USAGE!!!!! Read or DIE:
In order to use spreadsheet mode, you MUST check the box for it and input data in THIS FORMAT ONLY: "SERIAL NUMBER" "STATUS" "LOCATION/STUDENT ID"


The script will automatically detect if you're doing a location assignment or student assignment. YOU DO NOT need to specify it yourself. Simply copy and paste straign from your spreadsheet, the code can parse th ecell tabs just fine.
